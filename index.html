                    About
                </h2>
                <p>This repository holds a catalog of works containing identification resources, complete with
                    bibliographical metadata and metadata on the types of identification resources within the work,
                    the taxon/taxa they distinguish, the geographical region they apply to, and their intended
                    completeness. Here, “identification resources” are identification keys, multi-access (matrix)
                    keys, lists of species descriptions with or without explicit comparisons to similar species,
                    and any other tools that can aid in the identification of species.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Works can also be added to help link between related works, for example by adding web pages
                        that collect identification keys on a certain topic (such as this project). Although the work
                        (i.e. the web page) does not itself assist in identification, it can be useful nonetheless, for
                        grouping works and if not all the works that are listed in the collection are already included
                        in this catalog. Another type of work that can be added to link related works are of a more
                        abstract type: when an author publishes a key to a single taxon in several bibliographical works,
                        it may be useful to include in this catalog an additional, abstract works consisting of those
                        several parts.
                    </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>In addition to works, the <strong>individual resources</strong> within the work can also be modeled, with additional
                    bibliographic metadata (e.g. page numbers), a per-resource specification of the biological scope
                    of the resource (e.g. key only for females, or larvae, or terrestrial species), and a list of
                    the species (or genera, families; the leaf taxa) that can be distinguished with the individual
                    resource, optionally with their taxonomic classification. For example, in
                    <a href="https://purl.org//identification-resources/resource/B501:1">
                        a key to the Dutch species of Pompilidae (Hymenoptera)
                    </a>
                    the species can be listed grouped by subgenus, genus and family, as well as with synonyms, as
                    long as this information is presented in the original work.
                </p>
                <p>Some data is linked to other sources: authors, publishers, and places of works, as well as works
                    themselves, are linked to
                    <a href="https://wikidata.org/">Wikidata</a>.

                    This application is intended to select the right key for you (and gives you the other options as
                    well, of course), automatically. This is based on a known parent taxon and the location of
                    the observation. The results are then sorted on a number of heuristics, such as the
                    availability of full text, the recency and completeness of the work, and the specificity.

                </h2>
                <p>The entries in the catalog are mainly focused on Europe right now as I have been adding the keys
                    that I have been using (and related works), but content from elsewhere is very, very welcome
                    (see <a href="#contributing">contributing</a>). Apart from collecting more data, I want to synchronize more
                    of the data to Wikidata or similar platforms, or at least link them better.
                </p>
                <p>As for the application, in cases where keys are available under open license, they can be
                    converted to a standard format and chained together in the interface. Additional improvements
                    to the (currently theoretical) identification interface will be researched.
